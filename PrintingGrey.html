    I think this is the coolest concept. My printer is the best money I have ever spent. While I have not made anything
    extremely useful, there is nothing so satisfying as watching an idea in your head literally solidify into a
    tangible object.

    To start you need basic 3d design experience. Fortunately, I learned about mechanical design and using these
    software applications. But with Youtube and some tutorials, anyone can learn! I use fusion 360 and found the
    transition from SolidWorks very smooth. From there you create a part, send it to another application that
    transforms the design into a sequence of moves the printer will follow as it oozes hot plastic. This is how most
    home printers work, but there are many other cool printing processes! Here are a couple low quality images of my prints!

      A juggling ball holder that is also a kinetic sculpture. Depending on where you place the balls, the sculpture will
      swing for a little but until it finds the equilibrium.

    My ultimate career goal is to create something
    useful, ingenious, and creative. As of now, I am far from that. However, with every print I improve. With every
    failure, I learn what not to do. The small success of this hobby make every failed attempt worth it. I highly
    encourage this hobby for anyone with the slightest interest in design. It's the future!
