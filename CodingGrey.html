    In college I used a lot of MATLAB, and actually really enjoyed it. However, I never branched out to other
    languages. I tried CodeAcademy lessons which were helpful, but never really drew my attention. Only when I
    began working on personal projects with Arduino did I start to really enjoy coding in my free time. I chose
    mechanical engineer because I never wanted a career I would be stuck looking at a computer screen. However, the
    more time I've spent staring at these pixels, the more I realize how truly powerful and creative you can be.

    After a couple months of a pandemic, the boredom pushed me to learn another language, Thai! I organized all the
    words I was learning on an excel sheet and decided to go down the rabbit hole of an idea to build a flashcard
    app. I created a simple testing suite in a terminal interface and was quite proud of the what I would now consider
    a very poor job. I moved on to creating gui for my program using tkinter and ended up overhauling every function
    I wrote. I have always been a slight perfectionist, if I see something I can improve or make more efficient, I do
    it. This is a very frustrating trait while building an app and learning the coding language at the same time. Because
    there is always, always, something that can be improved and over hauled. However, these hard learned lessons have
    influenced how I live my life. It is always best to architect and thoroughly think through all your ideas. Rushing
    things will often cost you more time in the long run. Then again, that's better than never starting.
  </p>

    Back to the Thai app... I eventually overhauled the idea to make it compatible for generic flash cards. The basic
    premise is to test the user on the words they know the least, using my secret equation... Of course I had more ideas
    along the way and have implemented more features, leading to this turning into a website. As a self taught
    programmer, I am very proud to say I wrote all the front end, back end, and everything! Lots of work but I realized
    anything can be learned from the internet and frustration. Check out LINK HERE!
