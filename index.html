    <p>
      This website was previously the platform for MyGreyArea. It is temporarily down for maintenance and restructuring.
      See a brief history below...

    <h1> Motivation: </h1>
    <p> I originally created this platform to learn Thai in conjunction with learning to code.
      I dove deep into the coding side as I learned all aspects of web development. Not previously being a coder, I was
      simply inspired by all that can be learned and created from the internet.<br><br>
      I shifted the motivation of a flashcard
      app to a platform to inspire others to connect and learn from each other.

  <div class="col-3">
    <h1> Functioning Days: </h1>
    <p>
      The flashcard app allowed users to upload data sets that were were easily organized and could be tested on. User
      stats would be tracked and the cards that had the lowest scores would be presented the most frequently.
      <br><br>
      The thought spot was a place where users could share poetry, thoughts, ideas, anything. Thoughts were organized by
      categories and presented in a way the user could easily find something to read.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-3">
    <h1> Future: </h1>
    <p>
      I am in the process of developing another site that serves a similar purpose of connecting people and ideas. I am
      not a big fan of how involved technology is in our lives, but I would like to utilize its power to create a
      productive space.
      <br><br>
      Let me know if any of these ideas have sparked your interest or you have thoughts on collective
      learning. Thanks for visiting!
